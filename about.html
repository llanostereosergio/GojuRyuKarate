            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>
                Goju-Ryu is a style of Okinawan karate characterized by its emphasis on both hard and soft techniques.
                The name "Goju-Ryu" translates to "hard and soft style" in Japanese.

                Key Characteristics:

                Balance of Hard and Soft: Goju-Ryu combines powerful, hard strikes with fluid, soft movements. This
                balance allows practitioners to adapt to various combat situations and effectively counter different
                opponents.
                Deep Stances: The style often employs deep stances, which provide stability and generate power for
                strikes.
                Breathing and Relaxation: Proper breathing and relaxation are essential in Goju-Ryu. Deep breathing
                helps to control energy flow and maintain focus.
                Internal Energy: Goju-Ryu incorporates the concept of internal energy (qi or ki), which is believed to
                enhance power and control.

                Training and Practice:

                Basic Techniques: Goju-Ryu training typically includes basic techniques such as punches, kicks, blocks,
                and grappling.
                Kata: Kata, or prearranged forms, are an important part of Goju-Ryu training. They help to develop
                technique, coordination, and internal energy.
                Kumite: Kumite, or sparring, is used to practice application of techniques and improve fighting skills.

                Benefits of Goju-Ryu:

                Physical Fitness: Goju-Ryu training can improve strength, flexibility, endurance, and coordination.
                Self-Defense: The style provides practical self-defense skills.
                Mental Discipline: Karate training can help develop discipline, focus, and self-control.
                Character Development: Goju-Ryu emphasizes the development of character traits such as respect,
                perseverance, and humility.
